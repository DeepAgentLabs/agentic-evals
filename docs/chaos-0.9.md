# Chaos 0.9 compatibility

## Chaos 0.9.0 interoperability

Chaos 0.9.0 adds:

- resilience probes: `HttpProbe`, `ResponseQualityProbe`, `LatencyProbe` and
  `FunctionProbe` check steady state before chaos, while faults are active and
  after recovery. By default no fault is injected when a pre-chaos probe
  fails; `require_steady_state=False` runs the chaos anyway and leaves the
  score inconclusive
- a 0-100 resilience score built from recovery, probe, latency,
  retry-efficiency and cost evidence, with per-fault verdicts. Components a
  run cannot show (for example latency without a baseline) are left out and
  the remaining weights renormalized. The score is inconclusive (`null`) after
  a failed pre-chaos probe, for dry runs, when no fault fired, or when no
  component can be computed
- a local run-history store for score trends, with `max_runs` and
  `max_age_days` retention, and a `--min-score` CI gate
- probes and scoring on chaos workflows, experiment files and the pytest marker

Native event IDs and fault types are unchanged. `ChaosReport.probes`,
`ChaosReport.resilience` and the matching `WorkflowReport` fields are optional
and additive. When a score was computed, AIOS exports add a derived
`resilience_score` measurement; inconclusive runs export none. Probe results
and the score breakdown stay in the `io.deepagentlabs.agentic-chaos`
producer extension.

See the [v0.9 guide](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agentic-chaos/blob/v0.9.0/docs/v0.9.md)
and the [offline demo](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agentic-chaos/blob/v0.9.0/examples/chaos_resilience_demo.py).
The resilience score summarizes the evidence of one chaos run. It is not an
Evals score, a release-gate decision, a deployment health signal or proof of
containment. No new shared schema, automatic adapter or hosted execution
capability is introduced.

The resilience score is Chaos producer evidence. It is not an Evals score, and it is not an input to `gate`. Probe results are steady-state checks, not EvaluationSamples. To evaluate agent outputs captured during chaos, convert them to native EvaluationSamples explicitly. No adapter, runtime dependency or Evals patch release is needed.
